Combination Method:

By default, it has a problem where the user has 3 tries to guess the answer, if it is not the correct answer it gives an explanation to the user and the user can try again.

Each time the problem is chosen it generates a random number from 5 to 15.

The program calculates the answer each time, and generates the explanation each time with each different number of the problem.

Background Information:

A combination is a mathematical technique that determines the number of possible arrangements in a collection of items where the order of the selection does not matter.
In combinations, you can select the items in any order. Combinations can be confused with permutations.
