The Pascal Triangle Method:

Asks the user to enter how many lines of the pascal triangle they want to generate.

The program prints an approximation of how we would normally see the pascal triangle in an image.

Background Information:

One of the best-known integer patterns in the history of mathematics.
Each entry in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it.
Pascal's triangle is named after the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal (1623-1662),
Who was the first to write an organized work about the properties and applications of the triangle in his treatise,
Traité du triangle arithmétique (Treatise on Arithmetical Triangle) in 1653.

Despite the fact that the triangle is named Pascal's triangle, the pattern was known long before Pascal wrote his treatise.
The first explicit description of Pascal's triangle was by Halayudha, an Indian commentator in his 10th century commentary on Chandah Shastra, an ancient Indian book.
Not long after that, Omar Khayyam (around A.D. 1100), a Persian poet and mathematician, and Yang Hui (1238–1298) , a Chinese mathematician, both discussed this arithmetic triangle.
Therefore, Pascal's triangle is also called Khayyam-Pascal triangle in Iran and Yang Hui's triangle in China.
