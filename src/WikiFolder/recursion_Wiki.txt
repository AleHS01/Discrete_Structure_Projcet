Methods within Recursion:

Create it with the objective of using the recursion methods shown in class,
and also some extra methods that use the recursion technique:

This Method Includes:

-Steps to Solve your Tower of Hanoi with the amount of disk you want
-Factorial Calculator: can take digit from 0 to 65
-Find GCD
-Find LCM

Each method uses recursion, accepts values from the user, and elaborates on the input, to deliver the final output.

BackGround Information:

Recursion is a widely used phenomenon in computer science used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler ones.
Recursion is a process by which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
The corresponding function is called as recursive function.
