The Fibonacci Sequence Method:

Asks the user to enter the number of fibonacci sequence numbers the user wants to see, and prints them to the screen.

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn , form a sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1,
the first few values in the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.
