This Set Theory Method makes use of the basic set functions, which are:

-Union
-Intersection
-Difference

In Union, you can join a minimum of 2 sets and a maximum of 4 sets: A, B, C, D.
Each set can be anything you want, numbers, letters, letters and numbers, words and more.

In Intersection, you can intersect a minimum of 2 sets and a maximum of 4 sets: A, B, C, D.
Each set can be of whatever you want, it has to have at least something in common in all the sets.

It has an option to go back and return to the main menu.

History:

Set theory, as a separate mathematical discipline, begins in the work of Georg Cantor.
One might say that set theory was born in late 1873, when he made the amazing discovery that the linear continuum,
that is, the real line, is not countable, meaning that its points cannot be counted using the natural numbers.

Set theory is important mainly because it serves as a foundation for the rest of mathematics--it provides the axioms from which the rest of mathematics is built up.

Sets are a fundamental idea in the study of mathematics and statistics, but they have a wide range of applications in everyday life.
Sets are commonly used to represent, gather, and analyse data that is comparable. In todayâ€™s world, data is extremely crucial.
Data is at the heart of every change that occurs today.
